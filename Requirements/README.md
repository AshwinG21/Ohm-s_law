## INTRODUCTION:

*** ***OHM"S Law states thst the current flowing through the conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across its ends.

*** ***Ohm’s Law is V = IR, where V = voltage, I = current, and R = resistance. Ohm’s Law allows you to determine characteristics of a circuit, such as how much current is flowing through it, if you know the voltage of the battery in the circuit and how much resistance is in the circuit.

*** ***An electric circuit includes a device that gives energy to the charged particles constituting the current, such as a battery or a generator; devices that use current, such as lamps, electric motors, or computers; and the connecting wires or transmission lines.



## OHM'S LAW:

*** ***Ohm’s law states the relationship between electric current and potential difference. The current that flows through most conductors is directly proportional to the voltage applied to it. Georg Simon Ohm, a German physicist was the first to verify Ohm’s law experimentally.

*** ***Ohm’s law states that the voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided all physical conditions and temperature remain constant.


*** ***Mathematically, this current-voltage relationship can be written as,

*** ***Ohm's Law Equation           V = IR

*** ***In the equation, the constant of proportionality, R is Resistance and has units of ohms, with symbol Ω.

*** ***The same formula can be rewritten in order to calculate the current and resistance respectively as follows:

*** ***Ohm's Law Equation          I=V/R

*** ***Ohm's Law Equation          R=V/I

*** ***Ohm’s law only holds true if the provided temperature and the other physical factors remain constant. In certain components, increasing the current raises the temperature. An example of this is the filament of a light bulb, in which the temperature rises as the current is increased. In this case, Ohm’s law cannot be applied. The lightbulb filament violates Ohm’s Law.
